Happy Data - Product Specification Document
1. Problem Statement and Goals
The Problem
In today's interconnected world, understanding the relationship between economic
development and human happiness has become crucial. However, accessing and interpreting
this data is challenging for students, researchers, and curious individuals. Current solutions
either provide raw data without visualization or focus on single metrics without showing
correlations.
We noticed during our research that most existing platforms are either too complex for
educational use or too simplified to provide meaningful insights. Students studying
development economics or sustainability often struggle to find platforms that can help them
explore these relationships in an intuitive way.
Our Goals
Happy Data aims to bridge this gap by providing:
 An accessible platform for exploring happiness and development correlations
 Clear visualizations that help users understand complex relationships
 Educational insights for students studying sustainability and development
 A tool that promotes data-driven understanding of global well-being
2. Requirements Gathering Process
Approach
We followed a systematic approach to understand user needs through AI-assisted persona
development and informal discussions.
AI-Assisted Persona Development and Requirements Analysis
We extensively used AI to roleplay di erent user types and systematically gather requirements:
Academic Researcher Persona:
 Needs: Detailed trend analysis, correlation insights, data export capabilities
 Pain points: Limited time to process raw data from multiple sources
 Goals: Research publications, teaching material preparation
High School Student Persona:
 Needs: Simple visualizations, clear explanations, mobile-friendly interface
 Pain points: Complex terminology, overwhelming data presentations
 Goals: School projects, general knowledge building
Curious Citizen Persona:
 Needs: Quick insights, country comparisons, intuitive navigation
 Pain points: Technical barriers, unclear data sources
 Goals: Personal learning, informed discussions
This process helped us identify that users want simplicity without sacrificing depth, and
regional comparisons are particularly valuable for educational use.

 Chart.js for interactive visualizations
 Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and API calls
Backend: Django Framework
 Django REST API for data processing and management
 Models for storing processed data and user sessions
 Views for handling API requests and serving frontend
 Django ORM for database operations
Database:
 SQLite for development
 Stores processed World Bank data for faster access
 Caches happiness report data to reduce external API calls
Data Sources:
 World Bank Indicators API (primary development data)
 World Happiness Report data (happiness metrics)
 World Bank Country Classification (regional groupings)
Data Flow
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. User accesses Django application → Django serves HTML templates
Frontend JavaScript makes AJAX calls → Django API endpoints process requests
Django fetches data from database or external APIs → Data processed and returned as
JSON
Frontend receives JSON data → Chart.js renders visualizations
User interactions trigger new API calls → Dynamic updates without page refresh
8. Technical Considerations and Constraints
Technology Stack Rationale
 Django: Robust Python framework with excellent API capabilities and ORM
 Plain HTML/CSS/JS: Maximum compatibility, no framework dependencies, easier
debugging
 Chart.js: Free, well-documented charting library with good mobile support
 SQLite: Reliable database options, SQLite for development
 Django REST Framework: Clean API development with built-in serialization
Technical Constraints
 External API Dependencies: Reliant on World Bank API availability and rate limits
 Data Processing: Backend handles data transformation, frontend focuses on
presentation
 Database Storage: Need to manage data updates and synchronization with external
sources
 Session Management: Django handles user sessions and temporary data storage
 Deployment: Requires server environment capable of running Django applications
Scope Limitations
In Scope:
